                            <li>Unpredictable fluctuations in order volumes throughout the day and week</li>
                            <li>Inefficient resource allocation leading to overstaffing during slow periods and understaffing during peak times</li>
                            <li>Lack of data-driven decision-making tools for managers</li>
                            <li>Need for accurate short-term forecasting to optimize inventory management</li>

                            <li>A consistent off-peak period was discovered between 3 PM and 4 PM</li>
                            <li>High variability in order numbers, with occasional peaks at various hours, indicating the need for flexible staffing</li>
                            <li>The ARIMA model outperformed others in predicting order volumes, achieving an RMSE of 1.50</li>
                            <li>Time of day and whether it's a meal time were found to be the most influential factors in determining order volume</li>
                            <li>Weekend days showed slightly different patterns compared to weekdays, with later peak times</li>
                            <li>Certain menu categories (e.g., main courses and desserts) showed stronger correlations with peak hours</li>
